## About The Project


### Digital Twin


### Drone
**Problem statement:** Enabling drone navigation inside a hospital for surveillance and routing between areas of the facility.

**Description of the problem:** In the current situation where the world is facing a global pandemic, basic safety measures such as social distancing and PPE compliance are non-negotiable. In high-risk environments such as hospitals, manual surveillance to ensure that people are abiding by these rules poses a threat on the person conducting the checks. 
Furthermore, in large facilities, finding a specific room, finding the office of a particular doctor etc can be difficult for people that are unaware of the structure of the building. Quick access to this information and guidance to the end point is vital especially in emergency cases. 
Over the recent years, drones and robots have been the most desired solution for many such important and labour-intensive tasks, however, there are not many ideal solutions available that address our issues completely. The main issues stem from the following:
* Piloting a drone requires experience and it is important to keep the hospital population to a minimum, implying that the flight of the drone must be autonomous.
* Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) is unavailable for navigation in indoor environments.
* The drone will require obstacle avoidance capabilities.
These are only few of the difficulties in navigating indoor environments. A custom solution to solve the problems stated above is necessary to ease up the workload and protect the hospital staff in the vulnerable position that COVID-19 has put them in.
